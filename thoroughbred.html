        <p>Thoroughbreds are the most popular racing horse in North America. This breed is considered a "hot-blooded" horse, which means it's known for its agility, speed, and spirit. It's a fine multipurpose horse that often has a career in other equestrian
            competitions besides racing, such as dressage and jumping, or it lives its life as a companion animal.</p>
